  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The binary has been renamed from 'jira' to 'jirac'.

      The old 'jira' command still works as a symlink for backward
      compatibility, but will be removed in a future major release.

      Please update your scripts and aliases:
        Before: jira issue list
        After:  jirac issue list
